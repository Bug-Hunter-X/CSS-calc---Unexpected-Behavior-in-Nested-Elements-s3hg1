To solve the issue of unexpected results from the `calc()` function, one should ensure that the parent element's size is explicitly defined before using `calc()` in a nested element to avoid incorrect unit calculations.  Consider using explicit pixel values or a flexible box model to guarantee accurate calculations.

Here's an example of a corrected implementation:
```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Explicit width for parent */
  display: flex;
}

.child {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  /*Calculation more reliable since parent's size is known */
}
```
Alternatively, restructure your layout to avoid the nested `calc()` calculation, or switch to using `vw` or `vh` units if relative sizing to the viewport is the intention.
